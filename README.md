## Conclusion
The strategy demonstrates a systematic approach to Indian equity markets with strong risk management principles. While the current win rate of 46.5% falls below the 51% target, the positive risk-adjusted returns suggest the strategy has merit. The larger average winners compared to average losers indicate good risk-reward management.

**Recommendation**: The strategy shows promise but requires optimization to achieve the 51+ win rate target. Consider implementing additional technical filters or market regime awareness to improve hit rate while maintaining the strong risk management framework.
